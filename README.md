# Introductory Machine Learning projects

This repository contains a few machine learning projects on which I worked on while I was getting familiar with machine learning and
data science. They are a good start for someone who is just getting started on ML. 


### Prerequisites

To get started, you must download these softwares and packages to get started

```
1. Anaconda 
2. PyCharm (optional but good to have)
3. Tensorflow 
4. PyTorch ( Not used in this repo but good to have)
5. Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib 
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
* To download the latest version of Tensorflow, visit [Tensorflow Install](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
* To download the latest version of Pycharm, visit [PyCharm download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
* To download the latest version of PyTorch, visit [PyTorch Install](https://pytorch.org/)
* For downloading Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and other relevent packages, visit [PyPi](https://pypi.org/)

```
# Sources of datasets

The datasets used in this project come from these sources. Please note that it is just a tiny subset of the sources of data that is available on the internet

```
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
* [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
```
